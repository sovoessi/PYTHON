Your computer knows what the current year is, which means you can incorporate that into your programs. You just have to figure out how your programming language can provide you with that information.
Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the year you can retire. 
It should prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire and display the output as shown in the example that follows.

## Example Output 
What is your current age? 25
At what age would you like to retire? 65
You have 40 years left until you can retire.
It's 2015, so you can retire in 2055.

## Constraints
• Again, be sure to convert the input to numerical data before doing any math.
• Don’t hard-code the current year into your program.Get it from the system time via your programming language.

## Challenge
• Handle situations where the program returns a negative
number by stating that the user can already retire.

# What You Learned
These problems were pretty simple, but hopefully they got you thinking about keeping input,  processing, and output separate.
When programs are simple, it’s tempting to just do some math or string concatenation inside the program’s output statements, but as your programs get more complex, you’ll find you need to break things into reusable components. You’ll be glad you were disciplined from the start.Head on over to the next chapter. It’s time to do some more serious math.
